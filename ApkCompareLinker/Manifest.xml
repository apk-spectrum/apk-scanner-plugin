Plugin Manifest
  Every plugin archive must have an Manifest.xml file (with precisely that name) in its root directory.
  If no archive file, can be possible existed only xml file with any name.


Manifest file conventions
  Elements
    Only the <manifest> and <plugin> elements are required.
    They each must be present and can occur only once.
    Most of the other elements can occur many times or not at all.

  Declaring class names
    Plugin elements correspond to Java objects.
    If you define a subclass, the subclass is declared through a name attribute.
    The name must include the full package designation. For example, a plgin subclass might be declared as follows: 
      "<package-searcher name="com.apkscanner.plugin.sample.PlayStore" ... />"
    However, if the first character of the string is a period, the plugin's package name (as specified by the <manifest> element's package attribute) is appended to the string.
    The following assignment is the same as that shown above:
      "<package-searcher name=".PlayStore" ... />"

  Icons and labels
    A number of elements have icon and label attributes for a small icon and a text label that can be displayed to users.
    Some also have a description attribute for longer, explanatory text that can also be shown on-screen. 
    In every case, the icon and label that are set in a containing element become the default icon and label settings for all of the container's subelements.
    Thus, the icon and label that are set in the <plugin> element are the default icon and label for each of the plugin's components.
    
  Enabled
    The most elements have enabled attributes that can set activillity for container's.
    It's can be possible change by the plugin manager or self.
    So, it's mean to default value for the container's when plugin's imported.


Manifest file structure

<manifest>

  SYNTAX:
    <manifest package="string"
              versionCode="integer"
              versionName="string"
              minScannerVersion="string" >
      ...
    </manifest>

  CONTAINED IN: none

  MUST CONTAIN: <plugin>

  CAN CONTAIN: <resources>

  DESCRIPTION:
    The root element of the PluginManifest.xml file.
    It must contain an <plugin> element and specify package attributes.

  ATTRIBUTES:
    package
      A full Java-language-style package name for the plugin. The name should be unique.
    versionCode
      An internal version number. This number is used only to the Plugin Update Checker.
    versionName
      The version number shown to users.
    minScannerVersion
    	The ApkScanner min version of supported


<plugin>

  SYNTAX:
    <plugin description="string resource"
            enabled=["true" | "false"]
            icon="drawable resource"
            label="string resource"
            useConfigurationSetting=["true" | "false"]
            useNetworkSetting=["true" | "false"] >
      ...
    </plugin>

  CONTAINED IN: <manifest>

  CAN CONTAIN: <package-searcher>, <package-searcher-linker>, <update-checker>, <update-checker-linker>, <external-tool>, <external-tool-linker>

  DESCRIPTION:
    The declaration of the plugin.
    This element contains subelements that declare each of the plugin's components and has attributes that can affect all the components.
    Many of these attributes (such as icon, label) set default values for corresponding attributes of the component elements.

  ATTRIBUTES:
    description - There is no default value.
      User-readable text about the plugin, longer and more descriptive than the plugin label.
      The value must be set as a reference to a string resource. Unlike the label, it cannot be a raw string.
    enabled - The default value is "true".
      Whether or not the plugin manager can instantiate components of the plugin ? "true" if it can, and "false" if not.
      If the value is "true", each component's enabled attribute determines whether that component is enabled or not.
      If the value is "false", it overrides the component-specific values; all components are disabled.
    icon - There is no default icon.
      An icon for the plugin as whole, and the default icon for each of the plugin's.
      See the individual icon attributes for <package-searcher>, <package-searcher-linker>, <update-checker>, <update-checker-linker>, <external-tool> and <external-tool-linker> elements.
    label - The default value is package attribute of <manifest> element.
      A user-readable label for the plugin as a whole, and a default label for each of the plugin's components.
      See the individual label attributes for <package-searcher>, <package-searcher-linker>, <update-checker>, <update-checker-linker>, <external-tool> and <external-tool-linker> elements.
    useConfigurationSetting - Display they each plugin setting panel of configurations into a setting dialog.
		useNetworkSetting -Display they each plugin setting panel of network into a setting dialog.

  DESCRIPTION:
    The declaration of external searcher by package or app name.

  ATTRIBUTES:
    description - There is no default value.

    enabled - The default value is "true".
      Whether or not the plugin manager can be shown to users  by the pacakge manager ? "true" if it can be, and "false" if not.
      The <plugin> element has its own enabled attribute that applies to all plugin components, including activities.
      The <plugin> and <plugin> attributes must both be "true" (as they both are by default) for the system to be able to instantiate the plugin.
      If either is "false", it cannot be instantiated.
    icon - There is no default icon.
      An icon representing the plugin. The icon is displayed to users when a representation of the plugin is required on-screen. 
      If it is not set, the icon specified for the plugin as a whole is used instead (see the <plugin> element's icon attribute).
    label - There is no default value.
      A user-readable label for the plugin. The label is displayed on-screen when the plugin must be represented to the user.

    name - There is no default. The name must be specified.
      The name of the class that implements the plugin, a subclass of IPlugIn.
      The attribute value should be a fully qualified class name (such as, "com.apkscanner.plugin.sample.PlayStore").
